		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your comment, M, and in light of your observations it seems that I didn&#039;t adequately convey my actual meaning.  I certainly did not mean &quot;Thank G-d we&#039;re not one of THOSE people,&quot; and even more emphatically I deny meaning being different from anyone in a strictly financial sense.  I was trying to bring to the fore the various elements of financial security (comparatively), the close-knit support system and the centuries-old tradition of family orientation that together form our own distinct culture that we sometimes take for granted.  Anything that sounds black and white, matter of fact or determinant is an effect of writing style and is not meant to sound SY-centric.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I see your point M. I guess I understood the ending to convey more of a be thankful for what you have tone. Many people forget how fortunate we are, not just as the writer wrote concerning being &#039;wealthy&#039; but because we have surrounding us, distinct values, family, and a close community. 

As you said we do not know what it is to be like them, so who are we to judge? I am sure there are &#039;regular&#039; people out there that are as happy as we are, with the same set of standards as we do. But I do believe we can thank Hashem for giving us MORE of an opportunity to live a fulfilled meaningful life. We have a stronger probability to succeed (happiness, education, career) than others less fortunate in the world. That I think can be generalized.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did not disagree with the ending of this article. Who are we (you) to say that &quot;It could be worse. [We] could be regular?&quot; I&#039;m not sure how it is appropriate to state something so matter of factly without knowing what it feels like to be &quot;regular.&quot; And what&#039;s more, &quot;regular,&quot; defined by you as being a gentile, encompasses too many racial groups, income levels, social structures, etc, for you to really determine that we are all too fortunate to G-d forbid ever be like &quot;them.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this article, it is so true and so real. I love the way how you said how we are so fortunate because its really true and we hardly ever think about it. I will definitley respond differently when ask when I have a rock on my finger at 23!]]></description>
