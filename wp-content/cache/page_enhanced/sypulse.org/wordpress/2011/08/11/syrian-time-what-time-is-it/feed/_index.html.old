		<description><![CDATA[a big part of syrian time is adopted from middle eastern culture though. the difference between polychronemic and monochronemic time orientation. it has to do with the Arabic culture that more than one thing is usually happening at once whereas one thing can only happen at a time in other cultures (America). I&#039;m sure that those who are concious of the appropriate times for tefila etc. are not following syrian time there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A noteworthy addendum: 

I recently heard an interesting lecture by Rabbi Miller, A&#039;H. The basic premise was about time--specifically, punctuality. As Jews, he said, if we say Shema just a few seconds later than when we&#039;re supposed to, then we completely miss out on the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah. 

The notion of &#039;Syrian time&#039; should not exist; it conflicts with the core of our religion. The only exception should be, of course, as the last commenter addressed, to utilize it in order to avoid danger.     

You can access Rabbi Miller&#039;s class, as well as thousands of others, on www.learntorah.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;SY time&quot; was a necessary system used in the old country. Whenever people were having events like weddings or whatever they would set it for 5pm, which meant 8pm to all Syrian Jews. The point was to throw off malicious anti-semites. In those tough times it was a clutch way to party safely. Fortunately for Syrian Jews today we don&#039;t need such a system America. Despite our comfort, old habits die hard as we are still using this time trick to inadvertently confuse guests of other backgrounds.]]></description>
