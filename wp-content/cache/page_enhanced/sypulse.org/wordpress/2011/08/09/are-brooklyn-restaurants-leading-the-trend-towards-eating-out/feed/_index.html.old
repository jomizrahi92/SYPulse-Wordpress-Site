		<description><![CDATA[In my experiences going to kosher restaurants I have yet be in one without an A rating. I haven&#039;t been to them but I highly doubt that the ratings are significantly lower than their NK equivalents. Also not all ratings are related to contamination, a lot of them are because of  fire hazards, and  because of the complexities involved in restaurant food laws which are sometimes unknown. On a side point, a mashkiach isn&#039;t a health inspector and isn&#039;t paid to be one. His job is to make the food is kosher and sometimes to put food on the fire. The owner and/or manager is responsible to make sure that the workers are preparing the food properly. So while it may have an OU or whatever certification the store has, the store health ratings are there for a reason. Stop the baseless hate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There definitely is a bias. As it is simple anybody with an agenda cannot write objectively, as we have only seen him blame the restaurant owners to blame for his own religious problems. How about some introspection? Maybe the author should try to gain insight on why it is so important to eat kosher in the first place, and subsequently have an easier time refraining from NK.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I&#039;ll agree to you that my wording is a bit strong and inappropriate based on who I was writing this to, I still feel that I am not incorrect. However, I am not one to commend someone who sins out in the open and admits his wrongdoing, only to quickly blame it all on the restaurant owners. While I&#039;m not the biggest fan of them either, they are definitely not fully to blame for the whole eating out fiasco. There are many, many people that have been able to stay eating in just kosher restaurants, including my own father that grew up eating ANYTHING. It might just be, that it is simply the &#039;weak will&#039; and peer pressure that is driving people to eat NK. This was not brought up in the article, and this I believe is the main reason why anybody sins. But go ahead, live in a box and blame it all on &#039;X&#039; without even considering &#039;Y&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[okay so I have heard alot of what us written in this article before mainly that if the kosher places were nice cleaner quieter etc. people wouldn&#039;t go to nk places. BUT i do think that kosher or non-kosher- there has been an extreme amount of focus on the restaurant and dining out lifestyle recently. i know people who would prefer to go spend money on lettuce in a bag and a morning star veggie burger than to make it themselves because of the &#039;outing.&#039; maybe i&#039;m coming off anti-social but i think eating at restaurants in general has become too much a part of our lives and instead (yes it may require some more work) learn a couple quick and fun recipes and invite your friends over or have evryone make something and eat on paper! 

in my family we go to a restaunt MAYBE once or twice a year! we love eating home there is nothing better than the the ambiance in your own home! instead of my boyfriend taking me out thursday nights when we know everythings packed and we get all frustrated with the waiters and service well relax with a home dinner and go out for dessert or drinks after...

my point is we need to get back to point where we appreciated the simple]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If your not happy with Kosher restaurants, stay home! You&#039;ll save money and eat healthier. No reason to eat not kosher food when you are really no more than a 15 minute drive from a kosher place.Its not your moms cooking so what are you comparing it to? 

And when are you going to these kosher restaurants? Mothers day? Fathers day? when you know EVERYBODY will be there and its going to be packed? 
Shut up, this article is a slap in the face and im not even that religious]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So on Tisha B&#039;Av, the day which commemorates our sorrow at not having been properly observant in the past, you complain about the service and price of Kosher food and use that to justify not eating kosher.  Why were you fasting today?  Will you fast on Yom Kippur?  Fasting it meaningless without being moved by the cause of the fast, and clearly you don&#039;t care at all.]]></description>
