		<description><![CDATA[If you are closer to Houston St than Kenmare (which is closer to Canal St), you are better off walking to NOHO for the NYU campus which has a kosher cafeteria http://www.campusdish.com/en-US/CSE/NYU/Locations/KosherEatery.htm. 

There is also University Pita which is located at 21 East 12th Street, between 5th and University Place but it&#039;s a bit further. If you have order enough, it might be they&#039;ll deliver. (212) 924-4333]]></description>
