		<description><![CDATA[I have been drawing since I was 9 years old. Throughout high school, I attended summer classes at various art schools in the city. When it came time to consider colleges, my father said outright, &quot;If you go to art school, I&#039;m not paying.&quot; 

I spent four years in a prestigious college studying another irrelevant but &quot;smart-sounding&quot; major, and I felt like I was back at square one when I finished. 

I&#039;m married now, and my husband helps me pay for the classes that I take at nights at a wonderful school in the city.  I feel that if you really want something, the effort will be worth the trouble. If not, then it&#039;s not what you were meant to do.

And please, don&#039;t do me the injustice of chalking it up to my husband. I work full-time, and those night classes are a hassle to work around, but when I see what comes out of it I know that this is what I am meant to be doing. 
Learning for the sake of learning is one of the most valuable things you can do for your mind. Though the quest for money might seem necessary, the quest for personal growth is sadly underestimated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this article is really true. I think it&#039;s heartbreaking when people have to give up their dreams in order to conform to the ideals they think the community has set up for them, but I also do think we&#039;ve been seeing more and more members of our community finding ways to balance out thier dreams and whats expected of them]]></description>
