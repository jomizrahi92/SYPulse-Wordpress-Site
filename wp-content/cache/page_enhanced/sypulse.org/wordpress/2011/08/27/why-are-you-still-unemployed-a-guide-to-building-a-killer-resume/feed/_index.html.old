		<description><![CDATA[This article is a true hilul hashem. Anna! In wake of the unfortunate events that occured last summer, how dare you offer such as advice as to lie! You should well know that all you are cheating is yourself. If you have true emunah in hashem, you would know that hashem would help you and place you In the proper job If you follow the ways of Torah and tell the truth! One lie and next thing you know the person is engaged in terrible illegal practices!
