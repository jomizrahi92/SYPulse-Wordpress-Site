				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Written By</strong>: Albert Maslaton, Sergeant in the IDF<a href="http://i1.wp.com/sypulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/slide11.jpg?resize=490%2C367"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915" title="Slide1" alt="" src="http://i1.wp.com/sypulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/slide11.jpg?resize=490%2C367" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s 4 a.m., and I&#8217;m sitting on my top bunk, in the middle of the freezing desert, waiting for my next guard duty shift in about an hour. This past week, I&#8217;ve gotten a maximum of 15 hours of sleep overall. I haven&#8217;t taken my boots off for the last five days. After my next eight hours on duty, I’ll get, maybe, if I&#8217;m lucky, a few hours of sleep. Such is the life, not only for me, but for the thousands of soldiers on the front lines of the Israeli army.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span id="more-902"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I get it all the time, from my friends back home and the soldiers here on base. Why are you here? You don&#8217;t even have to be here. You could be back at home, working, going out with friends, girlfriends, maybe even going to law school like you planned on when you were young. You had freedom, yet you chose to come here?! The worst of it was from my parents. &#8220;Hey ma, um, I think I just signed on for an extra year to go to sergeant school.&#8221; &#8220;You did WHATT?!&#8221; I&#8217;ve already started to dread the fact that I have to tell her I want to stay even longer to become an officer.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: #000000;">I get it. I&#8217;m not some action-junkie G.I. Joe looking to be some decorated hero for the adrenaline rush or whatever. Though honestly speaking, at 22, I&#8217;ve done it all. I&#8217;ve worked and actually made some money while graduating college and getting a degree. I&#8217;ve studied for a year in a yeshiva in Jerusalem. I&#8217;ve traveled  I&#8217;ve had girlfriends and the best group of friends one can ask for. So why am I here, with my breakfasts of one hard boiled egg, twice (maybe) a week showers and darkened eyes from lack of sleep?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I spent this past week sitting in an outpost in the south of Israel. All I saw in every direction were miles of nothingness. Emptiness. Desert. A fence. I started to wonder what I’m doing here, how obsolete the whole area was. Who would want this place? What am I defending? I finally got a leave from my base and visited the neighboring community. Sitting in a café, in full uniform, gun in hand, an old lady came up to me and thanked me. I chuckled and said &#8220;For what? I&#8217;ve been sitting in a guard tower the whole week in the middle of nowhere.&#8221; She told me, ten years ago, before there was a watch presence there, the community was under constant attack, but now that there&#8217;s an outpost there, she can now walk her grandchildren to the playground without fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It hit me right there. The same feeling I got when putting on my uniform for the first time. The same feeling I got when I swore, at the Kotel, in front of the Israeli flag, gun in my right hand, Tanach over my heart, to protect this country and its residents at all costs.  The same feeling I got after completing a 17 hour, 60 kilometer, march in full battle gear to mark the end of training and my being recognized as a combat soldier. It&#8217;s the same feeling I got when I was chosen for extra training, to lead thirteen soldiers into battle as a commander. The reminder that I am here not only for myself but for all of Am Yisrael to have a place to call home. I am here to uphold the traditions of all those who bravely served before me. I am here to honor all those who have fallen for this country. I am part of something so much bigger than myself. And for the first time in my 22 years, I feel like I truly understand my life’s purpose. And the fulfillment from this knowledge is worth more than all of the money or degrees the world can offer.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: #000000;">So yeah, maybe I didn&#8217;t follow your normal career path. I didn&#8217;t marry at 21, I&#8217;m not the next rising salesman making six figures and I&#8217;m not in an Ivy League law school. Despite all these &#8220;shortcomings,&#8221; I have to say: I&#8217;ve never felt this accomplished in my life. Gearing up at 2 a.m. for a patrol is not a chore to me; I take it as an honor. To put on this uniform each day is a privilege.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: #000000;"> I didn&#8217;t do the &#8220;normal&#8221; thing, and there&#8217;s not a chance that I regret it, not even for a second.</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/sypulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/are-you-my-mother-article.jpg?resize=175%2C248"><img class="size-full wp-image-97 aligncenter" title="are you my mother article" src="http://i0.wp.com/sypulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/are-you-my-mother-article.jpg?resize=175%2C248" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;You have had a woman, living in your basement and eating your leftovers for five years. Have you any idea what her last name is?&#8221;<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span id="more-94"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">A cousin of mine is what our community would call a true &#8220;Eshet Chail&#8221;, a woman of valor. She is attractive, she dresses to kill, she cooks like Martha Stewart, and she has 4 beautiful kids. On top of all of this, she still makes a conscious effort to spend time with her friends and celebrate every menial event with them and of course buy them appropriate thoughtful gifts. Now this is a woman who is always on her &#8220;A&#8221; game, and one to truly emulate.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Or is it?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> One may wonder how it is possible to run a household with the precision of a german engineer while still getting the opportunity to attend spin class for two hours before getting decked to attend yet another wedding in Shaare Zion . Obviously this is all made possible with the help of two dutiful mexican elves named Anna and Loupe . These women run my cousin&#8217;s house like a factory, and leave her schedule free to accomplish other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Maids (or Chadames as we address them when we don&#8217;t want them to know we are talking about them) do everything for us. From walking the dog to cooking dinner, they have mastered the tasks that mommy no longer has time for.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> This would all be fine and dandy, however the one task that we define as one of the most important of all is left to them as well. That is the task of raising children.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Many of us have close bonds with our maids and see them as part of the family, but I ask you one question: You have had a woman, living in your basement and eating your leftovers for five years. Have you any idea what her last name is?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Do you really trust a woman who you barely know to handle your child and teach it the correct way to act and behave when you barely know anything more than the country she came from?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> The way one raises a child is essential. Things like manners, behavior, and grooming are not just parlor tricks. These are skills that carry you through life and define you as an individual. They should be drilled into a child&#8217;s head from an early age by one who can provide an decent example. To leave this training process to a maid is not like sending a dog to a trainer. It needs careful consideration and thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Personally, I was for the most part raised by maids. One issue that this caused in my life is poor organization. I have major issues putting things away or cleaning up after myself because I literally never had to. When I poured myself a glass of orange juice, the Tropicana carton always magically made its way back into the fridge. When I didn&#8217;t like a shirt and left it on the floor it magically made its way back into my closet perfectly starched and ironed. Toys always put away, and messes always cleaned by these mystical elves that made everything spotless once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Getting older and attempting to correct my mistakes is actually a challenge because cleaning up is not second nature to me. I can step into my bedroom on a Sunday night and quiver at the striking similarities between my room and a recent episode of hoarders. This is not where I want to be as an adult, and it is definitely not how I would want my children brought up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> I don&#8217;t believe that I am a freak occurrence in this over-indulgent lifestyle of ours. I know of children who spoke Spanish before English, or children whose first words were their maid&#8217;s names. These stories may be humorous at first but in reality it shows our pathetic dependence on others to do things we should be doing ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> In short, hired help may simplify our lives with many things, however it is the difficult things in life that are always more rewarding.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#000000;"><a href="http://sypulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/211.jpg"><span style="color:#000000;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-33" title="21" src="http://i2.wp.com/sypulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/211.jpg?resize=300%2C136" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For many, 21 is a rite of passage—a lawful allowance to abuse alcohol to the point of oblivion; an official initiation into the morphing “early twenties” that many a senior have hoped to return to; a year where undergrad ends and real life smacks you in the face.<span id="more-31"></span> For America, 21 is a vital year in the thirty or forty that comprise of our youth. For a Syrian girl, 21 is the checkpoint in the race to the altar. Wait! Hold on! This is not another lament of a post-teen single—I swear I’m not here to cry pity tears.  I simply want to challenge the undeclared battle against the social clock.  Some perspective:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I am sitting on the beach, surrounded by a pre-teen rocking half a million dollars worth of life commitment on one bony finger, and an adolescent sporting a baby bump through her crop top. I am politely enduring another dismal conversation of butcher bill woes and nursing- versus- formula myths.  As the sun slowly erases years away from my already dwindling life span, I gently tap the delicate corners of my eyes in search of premature crows feet. I am, as you may have guessed, 21. And—dare I say it—single.  If I thought graduating high school set off the Get-The-Hell-Out-Of-The-House bells in my mother’s head, boy did I have it coming for me at 21.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Before you question my sentiment – I can already see the eye roll and hear the “she put all the pressure on herself” crap—let me bring you an example that is possibly a daily occurrence for a girl in my situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Meet older Syrian mother.  Unbearable small talk ensues. Among this is included: “how old are you, honey?” to which I respond with a somewhat defeated smile “twenty one,” which is almost always followed by an effortful “you’re a baby!” and the dimming of a light behind said mother’s pupil, reading: uh-oh. Damaged goods. Gears begin to turn as mother racks her brain for a guy- ANY guy- for this poor, unmarried girl. Half a minute goes by before I am relegated with the questionable name of  a 32 year old quarter- Sephardic realtor from somewhere in the tri-state area who is, obviously, a <em>really good boy. </em>After politely nodding and smiling with the knowledge that as usual—and thankfully, in this scenario—there would be no follow- through, my day has been significantly dampened at the thought that I must find someone soon, as in, <em>this year. </em> I then return home and push aside my grad school application/ delicious fiction novel/ journal/something really important  in order to scour facebook for a suitable marriage prospect.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Can you say PATHETIC? I can.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Now, I must ask- WHEN did it become taboo to grow up?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I look again at the girls that surround me—those who’s “growing up” was marked by the slap of a Cartier on a pre-pubescent wrist.  While I can’t help but covet their freedom from such pressures, I am eternally grateful for having had these vital years to form my identity. (That is not to say an identity is ever static, because I do believe we are forever growing. Nonetheless, the personal development between the ages of 18 and 21, at least in my experience, were exponential and life-altering.) Now, don’t get me wrong- I fully understand that as a Jewish Syrian community, emphasis on building a family is justified in its intentions as preservation of the Jewish race—but, we can all agree that: A. the purpose for marriage is no longer so pure, and B. times are a-changin’ and so should we. That is only to say that equal attention should be paid to the encouragement of education, work, and personal growth. This is so important, because personally, had I gotten married fresh-faced out of high school, I would have undoubtedly been trapped living a life I thought I wanted. I see now how valuable my life experience hitherto has been, and can only imagine grander changes for my future.  More than that, when I acknowledge what has happened in these passed few years, the challenges I’ve faced and overcome, the mistakes I made and learned from, the mini milestones &#8212; I am PROUD of who I’ve become, and am enormously energized to continue pursuing my budding passions. With this revelation and sense of solace, I look to girls older than me—girls with master’s degrees, full-blown careers, over-stamped passports, creative expertise—with admiration and a new zeal for life.  We are the new women of today—independent, driven, innovative, artistic. Women who should be respected, regarded, and appreciated.  And one day, at the right time, WE WILL ALL GET MARRIED. And then I can return my cats to the wild.</span></p>

If you were ever a camper or a counselor, memories should begin to flood your memory bank when thinki</span><span style="color:#000000;">ng about color war.</span></span></div>
</div>
</div>
<div><span style="color:#000000;"><span id="more-52"></span></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#000000;"> </span>As a camper, I remember being tortured to memorize the song, with the general screaming &#8220;I went all the way down to the other field and couldn&#8217;t hear you guys&#8221;, and &#8221; I went into the other team&#8217;s room and heard them singing and they are so much better than you guys&#8221;. (I guess they didn&#8217;t know about positive reinforcement). We were taught that nothing else mattered in life besides for getting 1st place in marathon. As campers we readily bobbed apples and shaved our legs with Popsicle sticks. We cheered on our teammates during Tug-A-War. At the end of the three days, I remember my heart pounding while waiting for the scores.  And for what? Maybe people remember which team won the following year, but I doubt as the years pass, people still remember. We can say we care because it&#8217;s a huge competition, and competing is always fun. While that is true, I believe the real reason color war is intense is because for three days everyone is working together to achieve a goal. I remember the first thing I did when I used to win color war, was turn to my friend and slap her five. While winning alone is great, winning with a team is a thousand times better.</div>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Having to trade in his musical career for a desk job. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span id="more-43"></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The other day I ran into a friend that I hadn’t seen in a few</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> months. I asked him what he was up to and, decked in the classic struggling</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> rocker garb of leather jacket, black skinny jeans, combat boots and beanie, he</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> told me to take a good look because the notion of having to trade in his</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> musical career for a desk job was weighing heavily on his mind and he feared he</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> might soon have to swap the v neck and jeans for a suit and tie.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Waiting on the subway platform with a guitar case on his</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> back, he looked like he belonged in today’s music scene but the burden of</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> pushing the pavement these past few years with no tangible results had begun to</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> wear on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He knows full well the struggle between wanting to pursue</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> music, his passion, and wanting to please his parents and settle down with a</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> family and a steady income.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“There’s too much pressure put on the here and now,” he told</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> me as we were headed to Brooklyn after his</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> band was done rehearsing for an upcoming gig.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">This scenario would have any musician questioning himself,</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> wondering whether it’s all worth it. But in a community where such a high</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> emphasis is placed on one’s income, the pressure for instant success is</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> tenfold. And it’s a pressure that isn’t isolated to a surfer here, a musician</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> there, the occasional film buff, artist, writer or person whose creativity</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> isn’t always appreciated at first glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">When one hears something like this, certain questions</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> immediately arise – was he doing the right thing? If he were living in a</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> different place, where the burden of marriage and children and thousands of</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> dollars of excess income needed for tuition, houses, cars and vacations, were</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> not upon him, would he still want the desk job? Or what if he wanted to pursue</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> something else that paid less or took more time to develop and earn an income</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> from, would his life be entirely different? Would he be more fulfilled and</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> happier?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It reminded me of an article I read in The New Yorker by</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Malcom Gladwell. In it, he wrote about two creative geniuses – the authors Ben</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Fountain and Jonathon Safran Foer. For Foer, who wrote his critically acclaimed</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> debut novel, “Everything is Illuminated” at the age of nineteen based on a</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> three day trip to his grandparent’s shtetl, the success came immediately. For</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Fountain, the achievement of his debut novel, &#8220;Brief Encounters with Che</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Guevara,&#8221; was just as luminous, but it came much later in life, after</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> toiling for eighteen years with no success.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Gladwell brought countless examples of creative geniuses, who</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> are a huge part of American history now, but who struggled at their craft until</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> they were able to perfect it and make a real name for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Almost half of Robert Frost&#8217;s most famous poems were written</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> after the age of fifty. Mark Twain published Huckleberry Finn at forty nine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Alfred Hitchcock directed his most famous films between the ages of fifty four</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> and sixty one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So in an environment where success must be swift and immediate,</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> can a Twain or Hitchcock arise, or is this kind of creative genius being</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> stifled daily?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">More important than the notion that success must be</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> instantaneous, there is also a kind of reverse feminism going on. While women</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> in this community are breaking free of their old roles as housewives and stay</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> at home moms, the men in the community are stuck in the same situation their</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> fathers and grandfathers were in. Women are free to pursue the kinds of careers</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> that might pay less but are more creative and at times more fulfilling while</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> men can’t seem to escape their positions as the main breadwinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“These poor boys,” said Paulette Grazi, a married woman</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> whose husband’s budding music career was cut short when he married young.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> “While I get to go off and pursue a career as a writer they have to sell Jonas</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> Brothers t-shirts to Kmart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“In a lot of people’s eyes, success has to be instant or</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> else you’re a failure,” my friend told me. He knows that for a musician the</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> struggle is an inevitable first step in the careers of even the most successful</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> ones, but he seriously wonders how much longer he can keep at it as his</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> parents, friends and peers find it might be time to give it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For now, his music is his life. He rehearses, records, plays</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> shows and tries to get in contact with record labels all the while knowing that</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"> the ticking of the clock is getting louder and louder.</span></p>

<div><span style="color:#000000;">In its second season running, Allegra Franco Sephardic Women&#8217;s Teachers College, funded by the SCA, is breaking boundaries in Jewish education.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#000000;">The idea is simple: air conditioning, catered lunch, Torah, and women. Sounds cute, right? Wrong.<span id="more-1857"></span></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#000000;"> It&#8217;s more than cute.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#000000;"> It&#8217;s revolutionary.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#000000;">As we enter into the fifth week of the program, I observe closely the goings on in the modest blue-walled basement. For the first time in a long time, I witness women of all ages, social stati, and level of observance, put their needlepoints aside and actually open a book and read plain and simple holy text. Day after day I watch as regular every day moms become their own Torah scholars, gleaning fundamental Jewish practices and philosophies from the stories they&#8217;ve learned from childhood. The sight is surreal- women whom you once thought were merely mah johngg masters and pro kibbe stuffers delving into the pages and arguing the use of one verb over another is remarkable. Whether it be humash, navi, Halakha, philosophy, or one of the writings, there is always a lesson to be learned. In the spirit of what is taught at AFSWTC, emphasis is always placed on peshat, and God&#8217;s message to us is understood at face value. In this refreshing new light, class participants are encouraged to read the Tanakh closely, question the incongruities, and search for answers. Slowly but surely, eager students are becoming well versed in Tanakh, recognizing patterns in language and connecting phrases and events throughout the book. Women leave class with a new perspective on the day, and hopefully on their family lives and Jewish identities. In a community where women learning Torah was once not only unheard of, but looked down upon, programs such as this one mark the dawn of a new era. This AFSWTC/SCA program is even more cutting edge by giving its students the tools needed to read and understand Torah on their own, making Torah less of a mysterious, daunting read and more practical and accessible. You can&#8217;t help but feel at home in a place where questions are encouraged, discussion is constant, and the coffee is always hot.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#000000;"> All classes take place in the basement of the Hathway shul annex (unless otherwise noted). The schedule &#8212; for both men and women &#8212; is available on <a href="http://sephardicalliance.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">Sephardicalliance.org</span></a>.</span></div>
