				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Short Blurb <a href="http://sypulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/4-airport-security-check.jpg"><br /> </a></strong><br /> I was recently at the airport for a flight to Florida when my carry-on suitcase caused a hold-up on the security line.  Apparently, mayonnaise and lemon juice are a threat to homeland security.  Not only that, but the airport officers were so intent on taking away my food that they let me right on to the plane with a paring knife stowed in the front pocket of that same suitcase.  I think I am justified in saying that I&#8217;m usually pretty nervous when getting onto planes in America.</p>
<p>Winter 2012: I’m <strong>driving</strong> to Florida.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re constantly selling. Whether it is convincing people to buy a raffle ticket, sponsor us for the <strong>Disney Marathon</strong>, or even getting people to like us.</p>
<p>We use our skills of selling every moment of the day. We might as well know how to do it the right way.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 5 tips to get money for the <strong>Disney Marathon, </strong>or just convince people to do what you want.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Bite-Size E-mail:</strong> people get millions of e-mails per day. One way you won&#8217;t just end up in the &#8216;delete pile,&#8217; is to keep your e-mail to about two to five sentences. Wouldn&#8217;t you read a two sentence e-mail?</li>
<li><strong>Send Questions:</strong> in your two to five sentence e-mail, try to end it on a question mark. Something like &#8220;would you be interested in my banana drink?&#8221; Why? Because answering &#8220;yes or no&#8221; to a question mark is easier than answering &#8220;let me know if you&#8217;re interested in my banana drink.&#8221; It takes less effort for your prospect to respond.</li>
<li><strong>Prime Time</strong>:   it&#8217;s difficult to get someone on the phone when they&#8217;re busy making sesame chicken (if they work in Chang Mao). Try right when they&#8217;re walking into the kitchen or leaving. <strong>Prime hours are</strong> 8-9am, and 4-6pm.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat Customers usually are your best customers</strong>: Why? Because they trust you. Example: think of how we trust Google to for<br />
Google+, Gmail, Google Maps, and more. I give Google, Apple, and Facebook access to my personal information because I trust them. (G-d help us.)</li>
<li><strong>Compliment the customer&#8217;s stuff that they already have</strong>: When you walk into a clothing store, and a salesperson tells you your shirt looks like someone vomited on it, would you shop there? No. (Unless it really was vomited on. Then they&#8217;re just being helpful.) But if they told you &#8220;your clothes are freakin&#8217; sweet,&#8221; and &#8220;if you like shirts like that, you&#8217;ll love what we have over here.&#8221; Wouldn&#8217;t you be inclined to hear what they had to say?</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck ladies and gents. Now go get your way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;"><strong>A short story</strong> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">I guess I’m the third generation of our family to be living in America, if you don’t skip over our dad. I won’t tell you were we come from because that would bring too much useless attention our way, and I know that Grandpa Rick wouldn&#8217;t have liked that. He and my gran were real old world type of people, real modest and private. Grandpa Rick built an entire wing in a hospital up in New York, the kind with all the big shot doctors, the best kind of doctors. There isn&#8217;t even a plaque that has his name on it. Would you believe that if I didn&#8217;t tell you it was the honest to God truth? Not even a measly wooden slab with his initials. Nothing.<span id="more-1773"></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">Gran’s name was Ricarda, my Grandpa’s name was Rick. He was a salesman, she was a salesman’s wife, but it was more than that to me, at least after that day. I never realized it was her all along who made us come back home, again and again. When I say home, I mean her home, my grandparents’ house; the pathetic loft of ours couldn&#8217;t pass for one if its designer toilets depended on it. The marble in the kitchen and the hard wood floors were great and all, except there never seemed to be anyone there. I realize now that growing up, I was alone most of the time, wondering were my old man was. I think I would have liked growing up in my grandparents’ house better. It’s a nice white house with red shutters hidden from all the noise in the city.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">Those Sundays when we all went up there felt like Sundays in a different country. The whole family was there, always. No matter how much my pop spoke about Grandpa Rick behind his back at the office, or how much mom couldn&#8217;t stand granny, they always went. I loved my pop growing up, but it wasn&#8217;t until my late teens that I started to like Grandpa Rick better. Pop just wasn&#8217;t as much of a man. My Grandpa Rick would never beat around the bush, he would always say what he meant. Pop was always the salesman, he didn&#8217;t know how to turn it off every once in a while. I read a book once, back in the sixth grade called “The Time Machine.” I can’t remember who wrote it, and I don’t remember the story, so don’t bother asking. I’m telling you because the name of that book is what that house was like. It could have existed 300 years ago, in the country where we come from, and the smells would have been the same. They used to speak Arabic to one another, and it always felt rotten to be left out of the conversation. I have to admit though, that back then, I was my father’s son. Whenever I and my cousins got together in that shingled house, we tuned out on our iPhones instead of visiting Grandpa Rick; I used to ignore him when he called my name. I guess you can call me a third generation brat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">I laughed so hard when Grandpa Rick tried to give me a Honda for graduation, thought he was trying to be funny. I punched my brother in the nose for calling me a chicken at age 15; I still remember how it stung when Grandpa Rick quietly called me a hothead under his breath. That was what he called pop during their fights. But the worst thing I ever did, the thing that happened that day, was when I stole; I became a thief, not even worthy of the dirt on Grandpa Rick’s shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">The story goes that it was a spring afternoon, a Sunday to be exact. We were all by the small shingled house away from the city, like always. My cousin Fatimah was fat. Nobody liked her much, my uncles always said that she was going to have to lose the weight so that her father could “move some goods.” My aunts went even lower. They never included her in conversation and whispered that she was doomed to be a spinster. I helped everyone by making faces behind her back every time she opened her mouth at the family table; it usually got a lot of laughs. I was a mean kid, and to Fatimah we were a mean family. I needed money, big time. I was taking out this girl that night, and I hadn&#8217;t sold any merchandise in a couple of weeks. Dad always said that if you didn’t have money, take it when you see it. Well, I saw it, sticking out of fat Fatimah’s jean pocket. Fat Fatimah had a fat wallet. During lunch I nicked it from her pocket. I only needed about fifty, but I kept the whole three hundred. It hadn’t been five seconds of holding it before Grandpa Rick spotted me from his place at the head of the table. I remember the fire that started in his brown eyes, the red color of his normally white skin. The most frightening of all, was the size of his fist that smashed into the right side of my face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">The uncles stopped talking, the aunts shrieked, my cousins ran and hid. Fatimah had actually picked her head up for once. The sides of my neck burned as Grandpa Rick shook my collar. My ear lobe almost ripped in half when he dragged me by it out the side door. My Pop, who’s a gangling sort of guy, rushed out after us; he was no match for the solid figure of my grandfather. In a matter of seconds, my father was thrown on his bony behind; his gelled back hair was all out of place. His sunglasses had both lenses missing. My mother watched helplessly through the window.  Her perfectly straight hair was the last thing I saw before Grandpa Rick took over my entire field of vision. He was mad see, more mad than I ever thought was humanly possible. He was shaking so violently that the fingers clasped around my forearms made my bones rattle. I couldn&#8217;t feel my shoulders. I was hurled to the ground, like a piece of garbage. “Thief!” I heard him shout, “Hotheaded dog!” He screamed half in English and cursed at me in Arabic. He kicked my ribs, he pounded on my legs, my eye turned purple. I was dragged to my car, shining impossibly bright in the sun, parked last in the driveway. My body was slammed down on the hood, the keys hit somewhere on my back. Hardly daring to look past my bruised nose, I saw Grandpa Rick’s brawny arm yank open the door. My body was thrown into the driver’s seat. My Grandfather spat on the floor and walked away, wiping sweat from his forehead. One arm over the wheel, my face against the windshield, I saw my father. He was still lying on the grass nursing his broken watch. I started my car and drove away as fast as my bruised legs would push the gas pedal. Every bone hurt as I turned the wheel. I guess what you could call me right then and there, was a third generation beat up bag of bones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">I finally got into Manhattan, into the parking garage, and into the elevator. The doorman thought I’d gotten into a fight but that didn&#8217;t make me feel any better. I collapsed in front of Helga, our maid. Two hours later I woke up on my couch, under a throw blanket. The curtains were wide open and I could hear every car that honked its freaking horn. For some reason, I wanted that house without all the noise. Worse than the cars was what came from the kitchen. The marble and granite allowed for every word of what was being said to be echoing in my ears, over and over. My father was howling and cursing simultaneously, my mother was screaming to be heard over him. They were never going to go back to that house without the noise; they had had enough to do with my grandpa. I don’t know why, but I wasn&#8217;t angry. I was more thoughtful. I remembered Grandpa Rick’s strong arms, and I looked down at my own skinny pair. I remembered how his hair fell all around his face and how his eyes burned me with heat. I got up slowly and dragged myself to the crystal mirror. I didn&#8217;t like what I saw. I saw a puny weakling with gelled hair and a purple eye. I saw a robber who got caught stealing a spinster’s cash. I felt the nausea in my stomach. I saw my puny hothead father, the guy who couldn&#8217;t help his son but had preferred to sit on the grass and inspect his ruined accessories. This was the beginning of the end. You couldn&#8217;t really call me a third generation kid who takes after his Pop. I wanted to be anything but.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">I started seeing things at the office. My Pop wouldn&#8217;t go to the house on Sundays anymore, but he’d still come to Grandpa’s office for his paycheck. My Grandpa Rick didn&#8217;t say anything, he just treated Pop like another employee, respectfully. Something in Pop changed though. He needed money, so he took it when he saw it; he didn&#8217;t care about what it might have done to Grandpa. He would take money out of the safe and slip it into his pockets; he would change numbers on the books. I’m not my father’s son. I compensated from my pocket for whatever damage he would do when he was back home, far away. Grandpa Rick caught me at it late one night. I thought I had it coming to me again, he thought that I was still a thief. I opened my mouth to explain, but he said he already knew. I spent that night in his office, half explaining, half crying all over myself. I was losing my Pop see, because I couldn&#8217;t stand to look at him any more. My Grandpa Rick told me that a long time ago, he had lost his son. I slept over the house far away from the noise that night; I hadn&#8217;t been there since I was beaten senseless. The next day I got home around 7 a.m, Pop came home around 8 a.m., he smelled like a late night bar. He and my Mom must have had some fun last night, I don’t think they knew I was gone, see. My brothers never come home either, it wasn&#8217;t such a big deal I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">I spent the rest of the week with Grandpa Rick. He asked street vendors about the weather, my Pop usually snapped at them to hustle. He kept a calculator and pen in his desk, my Pop had a pack of cards and some gin. That month, my Grandpa Rick brought in the most sales. My Pop had a total of zero. At this point, even I could tell that Grandpa Rick was paying Pop for no good reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">At fat Fatiamah’s wedding a few months later, I spent the entire night talking to my Grandpa. My father danced with women who weren&#8217;t my mother, my mother accepted drinks from men who were not my father. At that point, I didn&#8217;t care. I and my grandpa just sat all night at a table. We talked politics, we talked girls, we talked life; in a way that was real to me. It was more real to me than any of the lines my Pop used to throw at me. No fake macho talking from zero knowledge. With Pop, politics was “people don’t vote, I pay a guy off.” Girls were, “What does she look like?” and life was everything and nothing at once. Only Grandpa Rick would talk to me straight. He was an honest guy, more honest than anyone I’d ever met. He retired a little later, so I couldn&#8217;t see him as much at the office. I still went down to the shingled house every day. I told my Pop when he finally got around to asking me where I was that I was with some girl. See, I don’t think he could have handled it if he knew I was hanging with his old man. My Pop is not his father&#8217;s son. We have that in common.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">My Pop built a wing of a hospital, special for stroke victims. That’s what got Grandpa Rick in the end. My old man gave a real sad speech at the opening about what a role model Grandpa Rick had been for him. A big shiny plaque with big letters is over the wing right now, my Pop’s name is there if you want to go see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;"> Only a week ago I cringed when the dirt hit Grandpa Rick’s coffin. I drove up in my Honda and a sports jacket. It’s how Grandpa Rick would have liked to see me. Pop’s running the business now, though he still hasn&#8217;t made any sales this month. I hope it will pass to me and my brothers soon when he gets bored of being boss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">I think of the grave sight, the final resting place of one of the richest men in New York. There was no inscription, no wreaths, just a small engraving of his name in the grey stone. Grandpa Rick was a man see, and he saved me.  I used to be a lot of things; but now, I’m just a third generation kid that misses his grandpa.    </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Written By</strong>: David Tawil<a href="http://sypulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/eli_manning1.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p>From the moment he held his San Diego Chargers Jersey with the fake smile on his face, I thought he had no shot. He was immediately traded to the Giants for Phillip Rivers and two picks (who turned out being Shawne Merriman and Nate Kaeding). He made his first career regular season start on November 21, 2004 and didn&#8217;t make it passed the first half of his fourth game where he had a passer rating of 0.0.<span id="more-1853"></span></p>
<p>The rest of his career he showed us inconsistent play. He had games where he was brilliant and games that were nothing short of a disaster. He did win a Super Bowl and had some nice comeback wins, but he still had not proven to be an elite quarterback. But an amazing Week 8 performance by this weeks &#8220;Sunday Superstar&#8221; might have changed people&#8217;s minds about the ability of the former Ole Miss Cotton Bowl MVP.</p>
<p>With his team nine point underdogs against an elite New England Patriot team, Eli Manning put together yet another come from behind win in the fourth quarter. With his starting center, leading rusher, and best receiver out due to injury, Eli still found a way to put the pieces together. With little time left, Manning hits number 85 over the middle (not Tyree this time, but Ballard?) making an amazing catch to keep the drive alive. He later hits Ballard again with seconds remaining for the go ahead touchdown, which proved to be the game winner. Brilliant!</p>
<p>So I leave you with this question. He has done it before against the Patriots in Super Bowl XLII, so why did we expect anything less? Is it time to crown Manning as an elite quarterback?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>By: Gail Mizrahi</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>I was 16 years old and knowing my SY roots, I felt it was time to start buckling down and get ready for the big M word… Marriage. I met this really cute guy in sleep away camp and we started talking and hanging out late at night by the docks (I know what you&#8217;re thinking but he was shomer so relax yourself). A month into the relationship I knew the L word was near (Love). So like any normal girl I acted as if I didn&#8217;t expect it and waited patiently for the time to come.</p>
<p><span id="more-1807"></span></p>
<p>One night we were hanging out at 4 AM and I was being all cute and flirty as usual. After staring up at the stars, he turned to me and said, &#8221; Gail I have something very important to tell you.&#8221; I looked at him with my big innocent eyes and said, &#8220;Oh Gosh! Do I have a pimple?&#8221; &#8220;No this is a little more important&#8221; he said. He continued and said, &#8220;Gail I book you&#8221;. As soon as I was about to respond with I love y- WHAT!!!?? You WHAT me? He goes,&#8221; Gail I really don&#8217;t want to say the L word until I&#8217;m married so for now, I BAGEL you, I FRENCH FRIES you and maybe someday I&#8217;ll even CARE for you but for now this is the way I feel. I’m sorry if I&#8217;m coming on too strong but we see each other every night and I&#8217;ve really gotten so close to you where…. &#8221;</p>
<p>All the words started blurring in my head. Did he just say &#8220;I bagel you?&#8221; Since I was an SY girl, thinking about marriage, I went along with this and said that I bageled him too. Yes, those words actually came out of my mouth. The next day however, when he called to wish me good morning, I returned to sanity. I nonchalantly answered and said, &#8220;Hey babe, why don&#8217;t we play a game?&#8221; I continued to describe to him a game that went like this: First, I would say &#8220;you hang up&#8221; and then you would say &#8220;no, you hang up&#8221;. Realizing that no one would hang up the phone, we flirt with each other instead. &#8220;Okay, okay&#8221; he said excitedly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll start&#8221;. He began by screaming,&#8221; Gail, you hang up.&#8221; I looked down at the receiver, repeated in my head the words “I bagel you” and hung up the phone. Needless to say, this was the end of relationship. I never spoke to the bagel guy again.</p>

<span style="color: #333333;">Barbara is an SY girl. Every morning, she jumps on the train to go to school, and wonders if the cute guy to her left is an SY also. The story does not end there.  As any commuter will tell you, there are seven characters that are sure to appear the moment the cool subway voice announces, ‘this is, Canal Street.’ Barbara groans as the first one boards the train….</span><br />
</a><span id="more-1786"></span></p>
<p>Meet <strong>DOC</strong>. Doc will fix all your problems, if you accept a certain god as your almighty savior. The salvation is coming, and you will suffer a horrible excruciating death. God bless you.</p>
<p>(Eye contact made with cute guy! Where does Barbra know him from? Is he dating now? Is he thinking about getting married? Is he an SY?)</p>
<p>Meet <strong>BASHFUL</strong>. Bashful says that even though he doesn&#8217;t deserve all the money in your wallet, he will insist on trying. When he starts singing Lionel Richie songs, you can be sure that he is sincere.</p>
<p>Meet <strong>GRUMPY</strong>. Grumpy doesn&#8217;t want any money, he just wants you out of his bleeping way. Thanks to Grumpy, Barbara now knows some very effective ways to say, “excuse me, I’d like to get off here if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>(Cute guy standing closer….)</p>
<p>Meet <strong>SNEEZY</strong>. Guess what? Sneezy has a cold, and now Barbara will too. Rush hour gives us so many little gifts to be thankful for. Sometimes the best tissue is no tissue, but the train pole is always a great substitute.</p>
<p>Meet <strong>SLEEPY</strong>. Sleepy is always tired. He’s so tired, that whether she likes it or not, Barbra becomes his pillow. Most of the time, Sleepy drools, and smells like something halfway between B.O and stale coffee; a pillow does not lead a life of leisure.</p>
<p>Meet <strong>HAPPY</strong>. Happy will sit next to you. Happy will stare at you with big, creepy eyes. He might even say something like ‘hey folks, it’s a beautiful day, don’t ride the ponies.’ Barbara can’t make this stuff up. Happy’s mom always told him that he was special on the inside.</p>
<p>(Cute guy gets off after 42<sup>nd</sup> street, not an SY….awkward)</p>
<p>Meet <strong>DOPEY</strong>. Dopey is not your average crazy. In fact, he’s beyond crazy, bordering on psychopathic. Somehow, all the Dopeys in the world manage to find their way onto Barbara’s train car, every day of the week. So far, she has received three marriage proposals, an invitation to a midnight duel, and last but no least, the chance to ice skate on the moon. Dopey, like all of Barbra’s other friends, is a character.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Written By</strong>: Vanessa Chalme, RD</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eating healthy: What’s the deal? It’s not about having alfalfa sprouts and juicing all day.</p>
<p>Nutrition is a hot topic and everybody has an opinion but somehow the message is not getting through. Here are the facts: <strong>1/3 of Americans are overweight, another 1/3 is obese, which only leaves 1/3 of Americans at a healthy weight. </strong>Where does that leave you? Whatever your weight is, calories you eat need to be balanced with calories you burn.</p>
<p><span id="more-1791"></span></p>
<p>You might ask what the big deal is with a few extra pounds, besides sporting the Muffin top look.</p>
<p>A poor diet and no physical activity will help you gain weight consistently over the years, feel tired more than you should, increase mood swing and crankiness, help you age and wrinkle faster, and increase your risk for serious diseases (cardiovascular problem, diabetes type 2, cancers).</p>
<p>Everyday you make hundreds of decisions; small changes can help you feel good about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> make small changes that become everyday habits for a lifetime of health. If you were to wear the same pair of shoes for the rest of your life, wouldn&#8217;t you want to take good care of them?</p>
<p><strong>What do you already know about your diet that is not healthy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Junk food (cookies, chips, ice cream…)</li>
<li>Juice and Sodas (liquid calories)</li>
<li>Fatty processed foods (pizza, burgers, fries)</li>
<li>No physical activity (fingers typing on facebook does not count for physical activity)</li>
<li>I would also add: coffee drinks, sports drinks, &amp; protein bars; especially since not everyone here is an athlete and knows how to use these properly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do you already know about a healthy diet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eat fruits and vegetables</li>
<li>Focus on Lean Protein such as chicken, fish, low fat dairy (1% or skim).</li>
<li>Choose Whole grains instead of refined grains</li>
<li>No Smoking</li>
<li>No Drinking</li>
<li>Exercise everyday for at least 60 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>For most people knowing what to change is not the problem, its getting there and sticking with it. Think about what you want for yourself and set yourself up for success. Set specific and realistic goals and repeat the goal to make it stick.</p>
<p>Here are some really good tips and tricks that can help you get started toward a healthier you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip # 1:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Power up with Breakfast: Within 2 hours of waking up, you have to eat breakfast:</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Try:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Yogurt with some crushed nuts and a fruit</li>
<li>Oatmeal with some nuts or a tsp of nut butter with a fruit or 2 tbsp of dried fruit</li>
<li>Whole wheat waffle with some yogurt and berries on top.</li>
<li>Whole wheat small tortilla, a tsp of peanut butter, add a banana and roll it up.</li>
<li>Whole wheat English muffin with a slice of low fat cheese and a tomato slice.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip # 2: </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No skipping meal and eat some snacks. Don’t go for a long period of time (more than four hours) without eating.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Healthy snacks:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Peanut butter with fruit</li>
<li>Cheese stick with some nuts.</li>
<li>Raw veggies with 2 tbsp hummus</li>
<li>Greek yogurt with some fruit.</li>
<li>Unsweetened apple sauce</li>
</ol>
<p>Plan ahead and if needed pack your bag with a healthy snacks</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip # 3:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Balance meals with the plate model for lunch and dinner:</li>
<li>Take your lunch and dinner plate and make ½  your plate with veggies/fruits, a ¼ with starch, and a ¼ with protein.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip # 4:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exercising:  Some physical activity is better than nothing</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Think:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Start with 10 min/day few times a week.</li>
<li>Buy a jump rope and start counting your jumps!</li>
<li>Find an activity that you like and find a buddy to do it with, its more fun!</li>
<li>Resistance training: to build and keep strong bones your body needs stimulation, so lift up!</li>
</ol>
<p>This is plenty to get started with, but remember to start small: Pick a goal and get working on it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<dl class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1756" style="width: 372px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt">By: Gail Mizrahi</dt>
</dl>
<p style="text-align: left;">So it happened again. I went to the airport and it happened again. This is a serious cause of FML. It was all going so well. I got to the airport two hours early, the right time of the day and I had sick food with me. What else can you ask for? My husband and I signed in and got ready for a 12 hour flight to Israel. Any other person would walk onto the plane, find their seat and sit there. Of course I&#8217;m not normal. When I walked to my seat, I find an old lady sitting there. &#8220;Excuse me&#8221; I said, &#8220;This is my seat, can you please get up&#8221; (okay, I really said &#8220;that&#8217;s my seat kish&#8221; but it&#8217;s always fun to dream). Immediately, she pulls out her ticket and shows me that it is her seat. <span id="more-1753"></span>Not only that, but her name is Gail Cohen. What?? Turns out there were two people with the same exact name, sitting in the same spot. Another Gail Cohen? How can the world handle that? And she&#8217;s not even close to pretty, that totally kills it for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Confused, I ran to the stewardess and said &#8220;Miss, I think there is some type of misunderstanding&#8221;. She bugged out as she looked at the two tickets. Recovering quickly, she said, &#8220;Let me speak to my supervisor&#8221;. In the meantime, the captain came on the speaker and told everyone to fasten their seat belts. All of the passengers (including my replicate who, I repeat, looked nothing like me) sat down. Every couple of seconds a stewardess passed by me and said &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, please find your seat, we would like to take off&#8221;. By the third time, I screamed, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have one!&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, after what felt like an endless period of time, the manager came and asked me to see my ticket confirmation. Since my father handled the booking, I turned to him and said &#8220;Da, where&#8217;s my confirmation?&#8221; My father immediately shook his head and said &#8220;It didn&#8217;t come to my phone&#8221;. The manager responded and said &#8220;But sir you definitely got a confirmation e-mail&#8221;. &#8220;No&#8221;, my father said firmly, &#8220;I did not&#8221;. Now, I am utterly confused. What is going on here? When the manager stepped away for a minute to figure this all out, I turned to my father for some enlightenment.  Embarrassed, he turned to me and said &#8220;Gail, I booked you under Mizrahi, by accident. You must have printed out that Gail Cohen&#8217;s boarding pass. If there wasn&#8217;t another Gail Cohen on the plane, you would not have been able to sign in for the flight and get on the plane.&#8221;  Was I going to get caught for identity fraud?</p>
<p>I repeat: Every other person would sit, buckle their seat belts and turn on Maid in Manhattan. But me? Of course not. I had to leave the plane to protect myself, and stay in a hotel inn for the night while watching the plane take off from my bedroom. The other Gail Cohen, was luckily able to experience turbulence and fasten her seatbelt. Uch what a life stealer. This was a serious case of FML.</p>
